        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> We may disclose your information where we are legally required to

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to access or store information. Specific information

        </p>

        <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>

            We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
            “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material
            changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or
            by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be
            informed of how we are protecting your information.
