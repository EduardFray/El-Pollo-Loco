<h2>Liability for Content</h2>
<p>
    As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 para.1 TMG under the general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we as a service provider are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
</p>

<p>
    Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.
</p>

<h2>Liability for Links</h2>
<p>
    Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
</p>

<p>
    A permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
</p>

The reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of use outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator.

</p>

<p>
    Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such.
